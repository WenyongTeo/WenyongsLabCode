'''
A Head or Tail guessing game is played by tossing a coin and allowing the user to guess either H or T.
Write separate programs for each version of the game. The versions have increasing levels of complexity:
a. (ifâ€¦else) The program uses a random function to generate either H or T. User makes a guess, and the outcome is displayed:
Head or Tail (H or T): H
Correct!
(User can key his guess in uppercase or lowercase(that is, H or h or T or t). Any letter other than H or T is considered as an incorrect guess.
